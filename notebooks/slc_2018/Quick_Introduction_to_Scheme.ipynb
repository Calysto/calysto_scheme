    "Let's define our first Scheme function.  The general syntax of a function definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scheme\n",
    "(define FUNCTION-NAME\n",
    "  (lambda (PARAMETER1 PARAMETER2 ...)\n",
    "    BODY))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note carefully the parentheses, which are part of the syntax of all Scheme programs.  The symbols <font color='green'><tt>define</tt></font> and <font color='green'><tt>lambda</tt></font> are special symbols used in defining functions.  The other symbols written in UPPERCASE represent parts of the definition that get filled in according to the specific details of the function being defined.  For example, let's define a function for squaring numbers, which we'll call <tt>square</tt>.  This function will take a single number as input, compute its square by multiplying the input with itself, and then return the answer.  The full definition is shown below.  You'll notice that Scheme uses the symbol <tt>\\*</tt> to represent the multiplication operator, and that the operator goes first in an expression (this is known as <i>prefix</i> notation).  Comparing the definition to the template above, you can see that FUNCTION-NAME is the symbol <tt>square</tt>, PARAMETER1 is the symbol <tt>n</tt> (there are no other parameters), and the function's BODY expression is <tt>(* n n)</tt>.  Furthermore, there's nothing special about <tt>n</tt>.  We could have chosen any other name for our parameter."

Let's go with the <tt>(square b)</tt> option, just for fun.  The multiplication expression $4ac$ can be written as <tt>(\\* 4 a c)</tt>.  To translate $b^2 - 4ac$ into Scheme syntax, we combine the two smaller expressions into a bigger one with the <tt>-</tt> operator in front:\n",

This is mathematical shorthand that just means \"either $+$ or $-$ can be used here\".  In general, the formula will produce two different values (or \"roots\"), depending on the choice of $+$ or $-$.  If we choose $+$, our expression becomes:\n",
    "\n",

    "(/ (+ (- b) (sqrt (- (square b) (* 4 a c))))\n",
    "   (* 2 a))\n",
    "</pre>\n",

    "Here I've written the expression across two lines for better readability, but Scheme doesn't really care how we write expressions as long as the parentheses match up correctly.  We could just as well have written it like this:\n",

The way a <tt>cond</tt> works is this: the CONDITION subexpression gets evaluated first.  If the condition is true, then the CONSEQUENT subexpression gets evaluated and the ALTERNATIVE subexpression is ignored.  If the condition is false, the opposite happens: the CONSEQUENT subexpression is ignored and the ALTERNATIVE subexpression gets evaluated instead.  <tt>Cond</tt> expressions are often used in function definitions to decide what to do in response to the input.\n",

If it does equal zero, then 0 is returned as the result instead of generating an error.  The definition is shown below.  In this case, the CONDITION subexpression is <tt>(= denom 0)</tt>, the CONSEQUENT subexpression is just <tt>0</tt> by itself, and the ALTERNATIVE subexpression is <tt>(/ numer denom)</tt>."

    "The CONDITION subexpressions are evaluated <i>in order</i> until one is found to be true, at which point the  CONSEQUENT subexpression associated with the true condition is evaluated.  The resulting value becomes the value returned by the whole <tt>cond</tt> expression, and any remaining clauses are ignored.

    "For example, here is a function that takes a \"sentence\" as input (represented as a list of symbols called <tt>wordlist</tt>) and returns a short message describing the number of words in the sentence.  If the sentence is empty, the function outputs <tt>(no words)</tt>.  If the sentence contains exactly one word, the output is <tt>(just one word)</tt>.  With two words, the output is <tt>(two words)</tt>.  Otherwise the output is <tt>(more than two words)</tt>.  Although this isn't a particularly useful function, it illustrates the use of a multi-branch conditional, and shows one way to determine the number of elements in a list (at least up to a point) using <tt>null?</tt> in conjunction with <tt>cdr</tt>."
