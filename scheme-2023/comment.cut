We would like to express our gratitude to Dan Friedman and the Indiana
University programming languages community, for instilling in us a
deep and abiding appreciation for the programming language concepts
and techniques that inspired the creation of Calysto Scheme.  We would
also like to thank Steven Silvester for his constant and continued
management of the Calysto repository. Thanks also to Jason Hemann for
many helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.
